# 3dsfetch
A fork of videah's 3dsfetch.

I was bored and wanted to make something for the 3ds and I remembered the old 3dsfetch needed a config file. I edited it to include some more information and detect it automatically, so the only setup you need is to choose a name when it launches.

One day I'll make it remember the name you picked

Probably
